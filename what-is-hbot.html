            <p class="innerheading"><a name="a1">What is HBOT?</a></p>
            <p class="intext">Mild Hyperbaric Therapy is a safe, effective way to get more oxygen into the body at the cellular level by using pressurized air chambers. According to the Laws of Physics, an increase in atmospheric pressure allows for more gas to be dissolved into any given liquid. Oxygen exists as a gas at room temperature, and the human body is made up almost entirely of water. The chambers used at the Hyperbaric Therapy Center use filtered ambient air with an additional oxygen concentrator to safely administer oxygen to the body with many therapeutic benefits. By allowing more oxygen to penetrate otherwise oxygen deficient areas, relief for many common ailments can be sought, because HBOT enables the body to carry out oxygen dependant processes by dissolving oxygen directly into the blood, plasma and cerebrospinal fluids.<br />
<br />
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is fast becoming one of the more successful therapies for children with Autism. Autism is a neurological injury whether caused by toxicity, birth injury or unknown. Some amazing results are being obtained, especially with young children

            <!--=============================-->
            <ul class="ulnav2">
            <li>Dr. Jerry Kartzinel and other Defeat Autism Now!(DAN!) doctors recommend 1.3-1.5 atmospheres and 1 hour sessions.</li>
			<li>It is recommended that your child undergoes a minimum of 40 sessions. Dr. Jerry reports benefits being seen at 2 – 20 sessions. Some children may require up to 80 sessions to see benefits.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <!--=============================-->
            <p class="intext"><strong>HBOT & Supplements – A Very Important Combination</strong><br />
It is important to note that many doctors recommend HBOT for children on the spectrum IN CONJUNCTION WITH antioxidant supplements. HBOT treatments can cause additional oxidative stress to patients.<br />
<br />
Supplements to consider taking while providing HBOT treatments are: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10, glutathione, and selenium. Doses of these supplements are based on the age, weight and testing of the patients. Please see your doctor for additional information and dosing.<br />
<br />
Some doctors do NOT recommend HBOT for children with the following issues:
</p>
                
            
            <ul class="ulnav2">
            <li>Central nervous system birth trauma (severe). Some children with cerebral palsy, stroke or other birth traumas can greatly benefit from HBOT. This needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis.</li>
			<li>Seizures (some variations may be fine for HBOT treatments. This needs to be discussed with your doctor.)</li>
			<li>Children with a severe sinus infections or cold should not do hyperbaric oxygen therapy until these symptoms subside. If sinus issues are chronic this needs to be discussed with your doctor.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <!--=============================-->
            <p class="intext"><strong>Brain SPECT scans</strong><br />
Monitoring of cerebral blood flow can be done with a Brain SPECT (Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography) scan. SPECT scans before and after mild HBOT sessions have shown dramatic improvements in cerebral blood flow that is sustained over time.<br /><br />

<img src="images/hyperbarics.jpg" border="0" /><br />
<br />
The above picture (taken from Rapid Recovery Hyperbarics) show the SPECT scans of a 17-year-old autistic individual before HBOT. The picture below shows his SPECT scan after 50 sessions, done between several times a day and once weekly. The improvement in blood supply continued to be evident one year after HBOT.<br />
<br />
The patient also showed improvements in social skills and grades, and a reduction in seizures, after Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments. Three recent small studies conducted independently at three different centres showed significant improvement in behavior ratings scales with mild hyperbaric therapy. Improvements were reported in the areas of:

			<li>Socialization.</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="intext">These improvements seem to correlate with the improved cerebral blood flow that has already been documented. Larger studies and more ongoing research may be needed before the results can be conclusive, but the initial findings are very promising.</p>

            <p class="intext">
            In addition to impacting cerebral blood flow in injured brains, mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to positively impact natural killer cell function. Thus, it enhances immune function. HBOT has also been found to reduce inflammatory conditions and has facilitated improvement in gut disease such as Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis.<br />

All microorganisms that infect the human body depend on creating or enhancing an oxygen-deprived environment in the body to enhance their survival – this includes viruses, bacteria, yeast, and parasites. These microorganisms are associated with worsening the symptoms of autism.

            <p class="intext">
            Studies have also shown HBOT to increase glutathione levels by 15 percent for at least 24 hours after therapy.<br />
<br />
Glutathione is vital to the detoxification and excretion of heavy metals such as mercury. Heavy metal poisoning is strongly linked to autism and people with less active glutathione are not able to eliminate heavy metals as quickly and effectively.<br />
<br />
These areas are all of interest in the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as they are often impaired in children with ASD.
