            <p class="innerheading">Food Allergy And Autism</p>
            <p class="intext">Understanding food allergies, testing and avoidance can be a confusing process for parents of autistic kids. The hard work of managing and avoiding food allergies – especially in autism pay will off with great rewards. It is all about addressing your child’s unique needs and avoiding allergens that can play a large role in how your child feels. Food and environmental allergies – even in the smallest quantities or exposure can wreak havoc. <br />
              <br />
            <strong>How Accurate are Allergy Tests?</strong><br />
            Often when embarking on the nutrition road to help improve a child’s health, foods can be the enemy in achieving that goal. For many families, avoiding gluten, casein and soy (the GFCFSF diet) is just the start. Not finding out all food allergies that could inhibit results and hard work in a GFCFSF diet trial.<br />
            <br />
            Your doctor will guide you on interpreting the allergy test results. Allergy labs are not always 100% accurate but help a great deal in defining better food choices for your child’s unique needs.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Best Allergy Testing Labs<br />
            </strong>Ask your doctor for their opinion on which lab you should use.  A blood test measuring allergies to obtain IgE and IgG food allergies finding is first step. These are important markers to investigate traditional allergies and intolerances. Both food allergies and intolerances can hinder health and negate hard work providing GFCFSF food choices. There are many great allergies test panels out there including the following choice: Super Religare Laboratories Ltd. The food allergy panel is typically labeled: IgG and IgE Food Allergy Panel. It is important to choose an allergy panel those tests for as many food allergies as possible.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Test Results<br />
            </strong>Since allergy testing is a valuable tool but not always 100% accurate. You can work with your doctor on which foods can slowly be reintroduced into your “ok food list” and how often this food can be eaten. For example: your child may show a low food allergy to broccoli or chicken. To test the food allergy, the doctor may suggest a complete avoidance of these foods for at least six weeks. Then following the six weeks the doctor will suggest a small serving of the food once a week and to watch for behaviors or medical issues (such as rashes or constipation.) Often foods that demonstrate a lesser<br />
            <br />
            food allergy than others can be slowly reintroduced back into the diet on a rotation basis.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Food Allergy Suspects</strong> <br />
            Be prepared to eliminate all foods that come up with as a positive food allergy for a period of time. Your doctor will guide you on which ones to avoid. The most common food allergies for the entire human race include:<br />

<ul class="ulnav2">
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Peanuts</li>
<li>Tree nuts (such as almonds, cashews)</li>
<li>Soy</li>
<li>Wheat</li>
</ul>


            </p>
            
            <p><br />
            These foods account for 90% of the food allergies that exist in humans today.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>The only true test of allergens</strong> <br />
            </p>
            <p class="intext">The only “perfect” test of any foods is called a rotation trial. You give a food for 4 days on, then not for 4 days and then give it again for 4 days, all the while charting the big 5 – sleep, rashes, redness, poop and behavior. You do not introduce any new foods, therapies or treatments, during this time. Simply, if your child has a problem with a food, you should remove it from their diet, regardless of any test results.<br />
              <br />
            For many families, they will evaluate each of these foods individually and remove them from their child’s diet. Then slowly add one new food back into their diet after a six week removal. Adding each food back in small quantities (i.e. a quarter of a serving,) one new food a week while tracking the results in a food journal can be an invaluable tool for helping your child avoid foods that aggravate their system. Parents should evaluate the following criteria in whether or not a food can be included in part of a regular diet in the following areas: behavior, sleep patterns, stool, rashes, and learning.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>The Serious Nature of Allergies<br />
            </strong>Food allergies can be deadly. Food allergies and intolerances can also greatly affect how someone feels day to day and negatively affect their overall health. A “little bit” of an allergy-inducing-food can greatly hurt and sabotage the hard work of implementing a GFCFSF diet. Doing the diet and allergy removal at 90% is not a good way to know if this treatment will help your child. Parents, caretakers, therapists and schools must be 100% compliant in keeping foods that cause allergic responses away from children. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>How Often You Re-Test Food Allergies</strong> <br />
            Food allergies and intolerances can change over time. Doctors recommend repeating allergy testing every 2 years            </p>
